## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Brian

Iâ€™m a Security Engineer who likes building small tools, learning in public, and helping people take more control over their digital lives.

I mostly write Python and build small tools to solve real problems, especially around automation and privacy. Iâ€™m always learning and experimenting.
