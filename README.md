## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Brian

Security Engineer by day. Learner, builder, and privacy advocate always.

I like writing Python scripts and small tools that solve practical problems â€” especially around digital privacy, automation, and making tech work better for real people. Still learning, always experimenting.
